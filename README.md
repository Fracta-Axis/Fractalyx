## Explanatory Diagram

![FractalShield — Self-organizing fractal protection](./diagrama-fractalshield.jpg)

*The Unified Fractal-Stochastic Model (MFSU) creates self-similar branches that grow in complexity under perturbation. The real layer (green) is hidden among indistinguishable decoy layers. Every wrong password attempt forces the system to evolve deeper, multiplying the attacker’s computational cost geometrically (3.5× / 7.5× / 15.5×).*

## What is AXIS Vault?

**AXIS Vault** is a complete symmetric cryptographic system built around a single physically-motivated equation: the **Unified Fractal-Stochastic Model (MFSU)**.

All primitives — KDF, stream cipher, hash, TOTP and the revolutionary **FractalShield** defense — derive from the same SPDE:

$$
\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = -\delta_F (-\Delta)^{\beta/2} \psi + \gamma |\psi|^2 \psi + \sigma \eta(x,t)
$$

with $\delta_F = 0.921$, $\beta = 1.079$, $\gamma = \delta_F$, $H = 0.541$.

### The Star Innovation: FractalShield
The first documented **oracle-free, geometrically escalating layered encryption** for offline files.

- No verification oracle (attacker never knows if the password is correct until they check every layer)
- Attacker cost grows **3.5× / 7.5× / 15.5×** per protection level
- All layers are statistically indistinguishable
- Everything emerges from the same MFSU field
